## List
List is the most basic data structure in Python.

To creat a list, use:
```Python
>>> my_list = ["cat", "dog", 261]
>>> print(my_list)
['cat', 'dog', 261]
```
The items in the list do not need to be of the same type, which means a list can contain ints, strings at the same time.

In addition, you can make an empty list:
```Python
my_list2 = [ ]
```

### Indexing
Each value in the list has a corresponding positional value, called an index, with the first index being 0, the second index being 1, and so on.
